# Layout Hooks 0.1.0

*layout-hooks is exploring a layout system that uses React to compute the layouts directly using React hooks.*

This project is a rewrite of [react-layout-generators](https://github.com/chetmurphy/react-layout-generator) using React Hooks. It is not yet functional but a work in progress.
